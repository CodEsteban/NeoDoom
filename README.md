## Background
Have you ever wondered how slow and painful is Doom Emacs? For configurations,   
initial installation, learning curve, when you just want to code!!!...  
It feels like it just works, but sometimes it doesn't, and that's where you F-UP   
((((((  I don't like elisp either  )))))).
 
All jokes aside, I loved the community, specially *hlissner*, keep up your work,   
is great!.  
I created this configuration because Doom/Space Emacs keybindings are another   
level of good as hell and i wanted to create a userfriendly  
configuration for neovim, one that I myself also use, is barebones, i might add   
a module system like doom emacs do.   

meanwhile, enjoy :)
